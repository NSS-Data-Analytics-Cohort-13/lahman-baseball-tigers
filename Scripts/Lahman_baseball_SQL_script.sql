--4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

SELECT * FROM fielding

SELECT (CASE WHEN fielding.pos='OF' THEN 'Outfield' END) AS Outfield
	,  (CASE WHEN fielding.pos IN('SS', '1B', '2B', '3B') THEN 'Infield' END) AS Infield
	,  (CASE WHEN fielding.pos='P' THEN 'Battery'
			 WHEN fielding.pos='C' THEN 'Battery' END) AS Battery
FROM fielding

----------------------
--new approach. Maybe CTE a table for each of the criteria then use the select statement at the emd to determine putouts and year of 2016?
